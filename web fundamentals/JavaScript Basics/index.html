            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="key">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="variables">var x</span>;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="key">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="variables">var x= 10</span>;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="key">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean, - <span class="variables">true</span> or <span class="variables">false</span>; null - null aka nothing; Number - <span class="variables">42</span> or <span class="variables">3.14159</span>; String - <span class="variables">"Coding Dojo Rocks!</span>;" Array - <span class="variables">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']</span>; and Object - <span class="variables">{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="key">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="variables">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="variables">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="variables">else</span> we execute this block of code;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="key">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="key">Functions</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table right way up. Done! We finished out instructions. Sadly there a a ton more table to do so lets call our function over and over again.
